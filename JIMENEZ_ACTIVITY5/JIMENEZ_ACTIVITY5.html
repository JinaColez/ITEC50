           Dear Mother and Father 
        </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
                Hi Mom and Dad, this is your son Renz. I would like to thank you two for the sacrifice you both made for us your son and daughter. This is me thanking you from the bottom of my heart because I could not have done it, what I mean is that without both of you I'm will not be a strong willed person as I am before. I love you both equally since you guys give your part in raising both of us. I will never forget the things you guys do. I will return everything with my undying gratitude. Even though the world might not now how deserving you both, but for me you both deserve every happiness in the world. I'll be thanking you guys for the rest of my life and I'll not regret every second I wake and live. Even if I become the world's wealthiest man I will never forget the two person who raised me, cared for me, supported me, and loved me. I will not have the best life without you both.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                I cannot count how much great things you give us. For that you, I want you guy to live long enough to see us be the greatest version of ourselves. I wish you both. Thanks again for giving us the joy of life. Hoping to see you again since you both are far from us siblings.
