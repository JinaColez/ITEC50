        1. Dorothy Hodgkin (1910 - 1994) <br>
        - Xray Crystallography. Hodgkin was a pioneer in the field of X-ray crystallography, a technique used to determine the three dimensional structure molecules. Her work help yo elucidate the structures of important biological molecules such as penicilin and insulin. reference: en.wikipedia.org 

        2. Antoine havoisier (1743 - 1794) <br>
        - Father of Modern Chemistry. He is most famous for disproving the phlogistem theory of combustion and laying the foundation for modern chemistry by recognizing the role of oxygen in combustion. He also help develop the metric system. reference: www.britannica.com
